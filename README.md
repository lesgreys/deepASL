# The ASL Project

Project will be split into several phases:

**Phase I:** Collect static images of alphabet, create CNN/RFC models, train, evaluate, and test models on static images. - Capstone 2.

**Phase II:** create CNN model on non static images, train, evaluate, and test models.

**Phase III:** develop external site and/or app to share with close friends and family to have them collect new data based off displayed words and have a gamification process of the training.

**Phase IV:** TBD

data collect: word shown on screen, person signs the word, can do as many of these as they'd like.
data validate: option to validate others signs. 

create a positive feedback loop in which data fed in allows user to gain incentives.
